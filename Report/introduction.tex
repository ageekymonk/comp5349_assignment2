	This report describes the implementation and compare and contrast the performance of HIVE Query and Spark Program on a given task. 
	
	Our given task is to find out how many times a user has visited a particular country, as well as the maximum, minimum, average, and total time he/she spent in this country.

	In both the implementation, our goal was to implement a scalable and efficient solution. We also took into account the code readability as well as one of the reason for using hive and spark is ability to understand code easily without much boiler plate codes.
