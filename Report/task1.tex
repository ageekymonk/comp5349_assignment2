\chapter{Hive Query}

	Query to find the max, min, total, average stay per user per country by using only Hive Query turned out to be inefficient. This is because we need to use triple join, which will be highly inefficient for big data queries. 
	
	To avoid this we have used Hive Query and a map reduce job to achieve our objective
		
\section{Design}
	So we split the task into three parts \\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item [Part1:] Join Place Table and Photos Table to produce table containing \(Owner, Date Taken, Country\). \\
		We have use Hive Query for this job because writing query for this task is simple as a SQL Query. This makes code readable for everyone. 
		\item [Part2:] Map Job to return the content as it is but distribute by Owner and Sort it by date. 
		For distributing and sorting we have leveraged Map reduce framework.
		\item [Part3:] Reduce Job to Find the Max, Min, Average, Total stay per User Per Country. 
		We used python script to do the reduce as this is simple to sequentially go through the time sorted list and find out the time a user stayed in each country. 
	\end{itemize}
